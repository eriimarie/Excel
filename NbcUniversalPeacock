Description: This portfolio highlights the skills and experience I gained during my time at NBCUniversal Peacock 
It showcase exposure to Decision science, research, and operations analysis.
This involved working with various departments such as software engineering, data engineering, automation, and research and UX/UI design. 
I also gained a solid understanding of testing and analytics related to project management and collaborating with PMOs.
To showcase my skills, I have created dummy data that reflects the type of work I was exposed to.
While this data is not real, it serves as an example of the type of work I engaged with and the knowledge 
I acquired during my time there.
